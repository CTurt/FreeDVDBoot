# FreeDVDBoot
PlayStation 2 DVD Player Exploit. This allows you to burn your own PlayStation 2 homebrew discs and play them on an unmodified console as seen in the [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ez0y-hz3VuM). With uLaunchELF as the initial program, users can include multiple homebrew programs on the same disc.

For the technical details please refer to my [blog post](https://cturt.github.io/freedvdboot.html).

## Basic setup
Using prebuilt ISOs in this repo ([PREBUILT ISOs folder](https://github.com/CTurt/FreeDVDBoot/tree/master/PREBUILT%20ISOs)).

### Step 1: Identify your DVD Player Version
Boot your PlayStation 2 without any disc inserted, and press Triangle to identify which DVD Player version your console has. 
**This is still early in terms of support for different DVD Player versions, check back here later for more support.**
Hopefully over time other developers from the scene will also contribute support for additional DVD Player versions.

**Currently only supports:**

- 3.10 (all regions EUMACDGJ - with English language set in settings) - confirmed working on hardware by CTurt, and others
- 3.11 (all regions EUMACDGJ - with English language set in settings) - confirmed working on hardware by [MrMario2011](https://twitter.com/MrMario2011/status/1277586569738813440), and others

UPDATE: Experimental hybrid ISO for both 3.10 and 3.11 support merged into one now available, burn `PREBUILT ISOs/hybrid 3.10 and 3.11.iso` and set language to English. Confirmed [working on 3.11](https://twitter.com/TheWizWiki/status/1277670129355161601).

**Please don't bother trying on an unsuported firmware/language configuration, it won't work...**

Language is also confirmed to [affect the exploit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zelVQcD7HCY), so please set your PS2 language in the system configuration to match the supported configuration (it should be possible to port to other languages in the future, but I'm prioritising different firmware versions instead of different lanauges to start with, since language can be changed).

### Step 2: Burn
[Pre-built ISO files](https://github.com/CTurt/FreeDVDBoot/tree/master/PREBUILT%20ISOs) for supported DVD Players containing just uLaunchELF are provided in this repository for ease of use (which can be used to boot homebrew over a USB storage device), such as `3.10 only - all regions - English lang.iso`.

You should use DVD-R (others work but put more strain on PS2 laser), and make sure to finalise the disc as burning option.

## Custom disc setup
 
If you intend to make your own image containing additional homebrew / modified initial loader, please read on. Step 1 is the same; identify the DVD player firmware version.

### Step 2: Copy your homebrew
Once you've identified your console's DVD Player version, copy all of the homebrew you would like to include on the disc into that directory in the `Filesystem` (EG: `Filesystem/3.10EU/`).

### Step 3: Make an image
Once you've placed all the homebrew files you'd like into the directory, generate a UDF image of the directory. The easiest way is probably to install `genisoimage` (comes pre-installed on many Linux distributions like Ubuntu) or `mkisofs` and run the following (where `exploit.iso` is the output and `3.10EU` is the directory containing `VIDEO_TS` and any homebrew):

    genisoimage -udf -o exploit.iso Filesystem/3.10EU

### Step 4: Test and burn
I would recommend you test in PCSX2 first, but since [PCSX2 doesn't support loading the DVD Player](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/issues/1981), you have to decrypt and repack it yourself, which is beyond the scope of this README. With that said, if you aren't touching anything in `VIDEO_TS`, there shouldn't really be any reason for the exploit to fail.

## Troubleshooting - please read
The disc does not spin on slim console - Press the lid down hard to ensure the sensors detect that the lid is closed

PS2 says "unable to read disc" - your DVD laser might not work, please try a regular DVD video first. If that works, make sure you are finalising your disc when burning, and I recommend using DVD-R instead of other DVD formats as those put more strain on the laser.

## OPTIONAL: Replace the initial program
I've included uLaunchELF recompiled with [DVD support](https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2sdk/pull/130) as the default initial program. It presents a menu which allows you to select any of the homebrew programs you chose to include on the disc (and also allows booting from USB).

Alternatively, if you would rather just boot into a single homebrew application, the initial program the exploit attempts to boot is located at `VIDEO_TS/VTS_02_0.IFO`, replace it with your desired `ELF` file, with the below caveat that compatibility might be lower than if you booted a program through uLaunchELF:

For the initial release, I didn't bother to reimplement a couple of functions used by the loader, so it requires that the ELF you load doesn't overwrite those functions I use (those are around `0x84000 - 0x85fff` and `0x250000 - 0x29ffff`). I will probably remove this limitation in the future, but all ELFs I could find were fine with this limitation.

You can run `readelf -l` to verify your executable satisfies this requirement. For example, this Tetris homebrew just uses `0x00100000 - 0x0017a940`:

	$ readelf -l VTS_02_0.IFO

	Elf file type is EXEC (Executable file)
	Entry point 0x104490
	There is 1 program header, starting at offset 52

	Program Headers:
	  Type           Offset   VirtAddr   PhysAddr   FileSiz MemSiz  Flg Align
	  LOAD           0x001000 0x00100000 0x00100000 0x72ef4 0x7a940 RWE 0x1000

	 Section to Segment mapping:
	  Segment Sections...
	   00     .text .ctors .dtors .rodata .data .jcr .sdata .sbss .bss

## DEVELOPMENT: Replacing the loader payload
The default payload will boot `VIDEO_TS/VTS_02_0.IFO` as an ELF file, but tweaks might be desired to improve compatibility, or maybe changing the behaviour to boot `BOOT.ELF` instead for instance.

If you wish to update the loader payload, run `build.sh` inside `PAYLOAD` directory, and copy the output `fullpayload.bin` to `VIDEO_TS/VIDEO_TS.IFO` at offset `0x2bb4` (for 3.10E).

## PORTING:
Please read my technical writeup, to understand how the exploit works. I've also provided some notes about porting in the `porting notes.txt` file.
